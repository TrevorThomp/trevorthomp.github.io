Today I completed the Jest and Python Crash Course and started completing other pre work that is due this week. I started looking into data structures with JavaScript such as Linked Lists, Stack and Hash Tables. Today re-enforced my knowledge of some of those data structures.

Tomorrow I plan on taking the day off and going to the mountain.
