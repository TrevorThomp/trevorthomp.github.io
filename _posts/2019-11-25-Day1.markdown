# Hello DevStation

When I was using jekyll strictly through github pages and not locally it wouldn't point the the _posts directory. I ended up doing everything locally so I can initialize jekyll and it will have my proper file structure and theme.

I will spend Thanksgiving this week with my family down in Salem depending on the weather, but either way looking forward to getting snow on Mt. Bachelor!
