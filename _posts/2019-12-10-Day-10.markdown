Today I completed more layout work for the 301 design project. I also added more functionality with my flashcards application that uses Pug as the template engine. Tomorrow I plan on adding more design to the project application and also finish functionality and routing to the flashcards application.

Today re-enforced some css styling and modularizing routes with express.Router()
